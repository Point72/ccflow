    "As the framework scales, the chances of two common types of errors increase:\n",
    " \n",
    " 1. Misnaming or mistyping of configuration options that could cause the configuration to silently fail (if the parameter was optional) i.e. \"threshold\" vs \"threshhold\"\n",
    " 2. Type errors and value constraints, i.e. the identifier string \"12345\" vs the integer 1234, or specifying that a parameter \"sigma\" should be non-negative.\n",
    " \n",
    "Typically, we want to catch these errors as soon as possible: when the configurations are loaded rather than when they are used. This also allows for writing testing of configurations that is decoupled from testing the logic that depends on the configurations, making it easier to spot issues quickly and easily. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to solve these issues, configurations need strongly typed schemas, with the option to perform additional (and custom) validations. There may be a need to coerce values (i.e. if the string \"1234\" is passed to a parameter that expects an int, it may be desirable to coerce it to 1234), and additional validation may be needed on the entire structure (to test validity of combinations of parameters rather than just parameters themselves). The use of schemas also means there must be a way to evolve the schema over time (adding and removing attributes), and even to version it if necessary.  \n",

    "In `ccflow`, we leverage the power of the very popular [pydantic](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/) library to tackle these issues, with some additional extensions. Note that while python's [dataclasses](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html) solve the misnaming/mistyping problem, they do not provide type checking or additional run-time validation. One can think of pydantic as a powerful extension of dataclasses which does."

    "Quantitative workflows are typically very hierarchical in nature. For example, portfolio construction depends on multiple signals, and each signal may depend on its own techniques and data sources, and each technique will have its own configuration parameters, and each data source will also have parameters that configure how it was cleaned/transformed and how to access it. Thus, the configuration framework must have a modular and hierarchical structure, which means that entire parts of the hierarchy must be easy to add and remove without affecting the rest of the configuration. In a file-based representation, this means that the configuration should be spreadable across multiple files spanning several sub-directories. The interactive representation of these configs must mirror the same kind of structure. \n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, the hierarchy of configurations can have complex dependencies, forming a graph structure, rather than a simple tree. For example, a data source may be configured to be transformed in a particular way, and then used in multiple signals, which are then all used as part of portfolio construction. If changing the configuration of the data source, it is then important that all the signals pick up this change. The challenge lies in defining this graph structure both statically (i.e. for trading) as well as dynamically in the python code (for research).\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, there should ideally be a way to automatically map a piece of configuration to the code that decides how to use it. Without this, the configuration can end up acting like a large catalog of global variables that proliferate throughout the codebase, with all the same drawbacks as global variables (including increased coupling between everything). So, each piece of configuration should get used by as few high-level pieces of code as possible, rather than by multiple low-level pieces fo code. We tackle this problem by frequently binding together the configuration parameters and the code which uses the configuration in a single object.\n",

Taking the idea further, one may also want to specify a workflow that applies to a specific region and time range, or even down to a symbol and date range level.

This occurs commonly when building database queries from parameters or when plugging data into an email template or HTML report. One common solution is to leverage python's string formatting capabilities, but this provides a minimal amount of validation to guard against accidents in the template definition, or malicious users (i.e. SQL injection attacks).

In this way, the registry is not used at all for run-time access, except perhaps as an initial entry-point into the logic. Furthermore, this code can serve as the bridge between the configuration graph (i.e. `ccflow`) and any other computational graphs which will be doing the heavy lifting. For example, the configurations can be used to define tensor graphs (tensorflow, pytorch), event processing graphs (csp, kafka streams), task graphs (ray, dask), etc, which are then executed separately.\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way to bind together user-defined business logic with the configuration classes is simply to add a method on the class. Following the [Single Responsibility Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-responsibility_principle), each of these classes should ideally have only one purpose, and hence following the python convention, we can name the primary method that commplishes this `__call__` so that the BaseModel becomes callable. The following examples illustrate this idea."

    "A common use case in any research/production framework is to send data from the current process to some other location. In extract-transform-load (ETL) processes, the target location is usually files, an object store or a database. However, automation of research reports containing tables, charts and HTML is another common use case; those may be written to files, sent to an experiment tracking framework or simply emailed to a set of recipients.\n",

    "In `ccflow.flow`, we used the principles above to define a very simple interface for \"publishers\" (`ccflow.flow.publishers.BasePublisher`), which are configurable components who know how to take data from one place and send it to another. The reason for having a `BasePublisher` class is so that publishers can easily be substituted for one another as part of the configuration of a larger workflow. If publishers were all implemented a little bit differently, then it would be difficult to switch from, i.e. writing files to sending an email purely based on configuration.\n",

    "While `ccflow.flow` provides several implementations out of the box for common use cases (files, email, [mlflow](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracking.html)), custom implementations of the interface are also straightforward. Below we will create a custom publisher that uses IPython's \"display\" function to display a list of strings as html. We use Jinja templating as described in a previous section to define the html template."

    "Gaussian Processes (GP) are a generic supervised learning method designed to solve non-linear regression and probabilistic classification problems. The GaussianProcessRegressor in `sklearn` implements Gaussian processes (GP) for regression purposes. For this, the prior of the GP needs to be specified. The prior mean is assumed to be constant and zero (for normalize_y=False) or the training data’s mean (for normalize_y=True). The prior’s covariance is specified by passing a kernel object.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example below, we should how `ccflow` can be used to configure a GP Regression (including the kernel object). Even though the kernel object is not a pydantic type, we can still configure it in this framework. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that `sklearn` must be installed to run this example. For the meaning of the parameters, refer to the [sklearn documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.gaussian_process.GaussianProcessRegressor.html#sklearn.gaussian_process.GaussianProcessRegressor); we follow their example for usage of the GP Regressor.\n"
