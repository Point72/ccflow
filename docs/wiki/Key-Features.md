`ccflow` (Composable Configuration Flow) is a collection of tools for workflow configuration, orchestration, and dependency injection.
It is intended to be flexible enough to handle diverse use cases, including data retrieval, validation, transformation, and loading (i.e. ETL workflows), model training, microservice configuration, and automated report generation.

## Base Model

Central to `ccflow` is the `BaseModel` class.
`BaseModel` is the base class for models in the `ccflow` framework.
A model is basically a data class (class with attributes).
The naming was inspired by the open source library [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/) (`BaseModel` actually inherits from the Pydantic base model class).

## Callable Model

`CallableModel` is the base class for a special type of `BaseModel` which can be called.
`CallableModel`'s are called with a context (something that derives from `ContextBase`) and returns a result (something that derives from `ResultBase`).
As an example, you may have a `SQLReader` callable model that when called with a `DateRangeContext` returns a `ArrowResult` (wrapper around a Arrow table) with data in the date range defined by the context by querying some SQL database.

## Model Registry

A `ModelRegistry` is a named collection of models.
A `ModelRegistry` can be loaded from YAML configuration, which means you can define a collection of models using YAML.
This is really powerful because this gives you a easy way to define a collection of Python objects via configuration.

## Models

Although you are free to define your own models (`BaseModel` implementations) to use in your flow graph,
`ccflow` comes with some models that you can use off the shelf to solve common problems. `ccflow` comes with a range of models for reading data.

The following table summarizes the available models.

> Some models are still in the process of being open sourced.

## Publishers

`ccflow` also comes with a range of models for writing data.
These are referred to as publishers.
You can "chain" publishers and callable models using `PublisherModel` to call a `CallableModel` and publish the results in one step.
In fact, `ccflow` comes with several implementations of `PublisherModel` for common publishing use cases.

The following table summarizes the "publisher" models.

A Result is an object that holds the results from a callable model. It provides the equivalent of a strongly typed dictionary where the keys and schema are known upfront.
